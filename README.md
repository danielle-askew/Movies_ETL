# Movies_ETL
For this project we created an automated file that takes in new data, from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata and the MovieLens rating data. It then performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into an existing PostgreSQL database.

We have accomplished the following:
1. Write an ETL function to read three data files
2. Extract and transform the Wikipedia data
3. Extract and transform the Kaggle and rating data
4. Load the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database
